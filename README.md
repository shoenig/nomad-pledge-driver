`nomad-pledge-driver` is a Nomad task driver based on the `pledge` [utility for Linux](https://justine.lol/pledge/) by Justine Tunney.

*Security through SECCOMP sorcery*

### Features

- Sandbox applications by **restricting syscalls** they are able to make (via _promises_)
- Sandbox applications by **allow-listing filepaths** they are allowed to access (via _unveil_)
- Sandbox applications by **restricting resources** using modern Linux cgroups (via _cgroups v2_)
- Sandbox applications by **namespace isolation** using Linux namespaces (via _nsenter_ and _unshare_)

### Use cases

The `nomad-pledge-driver` is intended as a replacement for `raw_exec`. Sometimes
there are those management tasks that just need to run as `root` and directly
access the filesystem or perform privileged operations. While `raw_exec`
provides no isolation, the `pledge` driver uses Landlock to restrict the files
or directories the task is allowed to access. Specific groups of system calls
are allow-listed, greatly  reducing the attack surface of a mis- configured or
compromised task.
  
### Examples

The example below uses `curl` to fetch `example.com`, with the minimal set of promises to make a request.

More complex examples in the [hack](hack) directory.

```hcl
job "curl" {
  type        = "batch"

  group "group" {
    task "curl" {
      driver = "pledge"
      config {
        command  = "curl"
        args     = ["example.com"]
        promises = "stdio rpath inet dns sendfd"
        unveil   = ["r:${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Building

The `nomad-pledge-driver` plugin is written in Go. It can be built using the normal Go toolchain steps, but
the Makefile contains a `dev` target to make things easy. The compiled binary will appear in the `output/`
directory.

```shell
make dev
```

### Installing 

The plugin should be placed in the `plugin_dir` configured by the Nomad agent, per Nomad's [documentation](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/configuration#plugin_dir).

You'll also need the `pledge` executable (1.8 or higher) that powers the plugin sandboxing.
Download the `pledge` executable from https://justine.lol/pledge/ and install it somewhere.
The plugin configuration lets you specify where the path to the pledge executable.

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /opt/bin
curl -L -o /opt/bin/pledge-1.8.com https://justine.lol/pledge/pledge-1.8.com
```

:point_right: **optional** It is very convenient to bless the pledge executable with the `cap_net_bind_service`
Linux capability. This will enable Nomad tasks using the pledge driver to bind to privileged
ports (e.g. below 1024).

```shell
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service+eip /opt/bin/pledge-1.8.com
```

The plugin will expose the `driver.pledge.cap.net_bind` attribute indicating whether
the `cap_net_bind_service` capability has been set on the `pledge-1.x.com` executable.

### Plugin Configuration

Currently there is only one configuration option for this plugin, which is to specify the path of the `pledge` executable.

```hcl
plugin "nomad-pledge-driver" {
  config {
    pledge_executable = "/opt/bin/pledge-1.8.com"
  }
}
```

Note: in these examples the driver plugin is named `pledge`, and the utility executable is named `pledge-1.8.com`. 

### Task Configuration

Tasks need to specify which **promises** they require in order to run.

Tasks also need to **unveil** the filesystem paths needed to run.

For more information about which pledges are available and how this mechanism works, visit https://justine.lol/pledge/

If no `user` is specified for the task, the pledge plugin will use the user of
the Nomad client by default. Like the `raw_exec` task driver, `user` cannot be
set in hardened clusters according to the [production guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/install/production/requirements#user-permissions).

- `command`: The executable to run
- `args`: The arguments to pass to executable
- `promises`: The set of promises needed for the executable to run
- `unveil`: The set of system filepaths to allow the task to access, and with what permission
- `importance`: One of `lowest`, `low`, `normal`, `high`, `highest` (default is `normal`)

```hcl
# see hack/http.hcl for complete python http.server example
# note that bridge mode also works, see hack/bridge.hcl

task "task" {
  driver = "pledge"
  user   = "nobody"
  config {
    command    = "python3"
    args       = ["-m", "http.server", "${NOMAD_PORT_http}", "--directory", "${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}"]
    promises   = "stdio rpath inet"
    unveil     = ["r:/etc/mime.types", "r:${NOMAD_TASK_DIR}"]
    importance = "low"
  }

  template {
    destination = "local/index.html"
    data        = <<EOH
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <title>example</title>
  <body><p>Hello, friend!</p></body>
</html>
EOH
  }
}
```

For help getting the plugin to work, see the [TROUBLESHOOT](TROUBLESHOOT.md) doc.
Otherwise feel free to file an issue!

### Contributing

The `nomad-pledge-driver` plugin is currently under active development - anything may change at a moments notice!

#### hacking

The included Makefile includes helpful targets for hacking on the pledge plugin.

To simply compile, run `make dev`. The output will go into `/tmp/plugins`.

To start Nomad with the plugin, run `make run`. Under the hood this is using the `hack/client.hcl` Client
config file, along with `-dev` mode defaults. You should be able to run jobs making use of `pledge` driver
when launching Nomad this way.

There are example jobs in the [hack/](hack) directory.

### License

The `pledge` task driver plugin is made open source under the [MPL-2.0](LICENSE) license.
